# Holistic-Body-Landmarks-Detector
This Python script utilizes the Mediapipe library to perform real-time detection of holistic landmarks including facial features, hand gestures, and body poses from a webcam feed. It overlays these landmarks on the live video stream, providing a visual representation of key points on the detected person's face, hands, and body.
